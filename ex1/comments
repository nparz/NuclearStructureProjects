a. 
The neutron seperation energy plot shows an obvious sharp decrease in 
seperation energy as we move towards more neutron heavy nuclei. 
Likewise, proton heavy nuclei have exceedingly low proton seperation energies. 
This seems intuitively correct. The largest seperation energies in both cases 
are in low mass nuclei. Pairing effects are quite noticeable from the plots, as
we see noticeably higher neutron and proton seperation energies for even numbers
 of neutrons and protons respectively. 

b. 
Qualitatively, the liquid drop model seems to predict seperation energies
 quite well in the medium to heavy mass regions. In the light mass region the 
seperation energies are exagerated greatly. (My plots do not continue to assign
colors to energies over 25 MeV, to facilitate comparisons with the experimental
 data.) The odd-even staggering is not evident in these plots. This is expected
because we have not accounted for pairing in the model. 

c.
Once again we see good qualitative agreement between the liquid drop model and
experiment in the medium and heavy mass regions, and poor agreement in the low 
mass region. Breaking the liquid drop model down shows us the dominance of the
volume term in the calculation. The surface and asymmetric terms play a large
roll in correcting the contribution from the volume term. The coulomb term
contributes somewhat for heavy mass nuclei. Perhaps the problems this model 
experiences in the low mass region are related to the fact that we use a volume
term with a surface correction to represent nuclei so small that they lack any 
distinction between volume and surface. 

d.
The Neutron Dripline has a fairly linear nature. Unfortunately there are not 
many experimental points for comparison. The points that we do have seem to fit 
nicely with the prediction from the liquid drop model, but we cannot confidently
extrapolate such a limited dataset to the higher mass regions.
